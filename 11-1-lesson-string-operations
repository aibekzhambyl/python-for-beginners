#Concatenation
#In Python math works with words as well as numbers.
#So not only can we add integers and floats, but also strings, using something called concatenation, which can be done on any two strings. Like this:
print('Spam'+'eggs') #result is Spameggs

print("2"+"2") #result is 22

#Multiplying string by integer
print("spam"*3) #result is spamspamspam
print(4*'2') #result is 2222
