#Newlines
#Ok, so we can generate text, but it’d be pretty hard to read if everything was on one single line, right?
#To create a new line we use \n.
#\n can be used in strings to create multi-line outputs. Like this:
print('One\nTwo \nThree')

#Based on what we just learned, can you guess how we represent tab? That’s right, it’s \t.
print('One\tTwo \tThree')

#\n is useful, but it can be a bit of a pain if we’re trying to format lots of multiline text.
#There’s another way though! Newlines are automatically added for strings created using three quotes.
#For example:
print("""this
is a
multiline
text""")
